        Below is aggregated donation info for the UNICEF donation lock. You can
        use this to identify donators that may be malicious or unwanted actors.
        Future functionality would include the ability to refund or freeze
        donations made by unwanted entities as well as integrating AI to
        determine if a donation is malicious or not (security score).
